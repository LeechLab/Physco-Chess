      <h1>Last Updated:</h1>
      The Second Day of April, In the Year of Our Lord Two Thousand and
      Five-and-Twenty <br /><br />Welcome, noble traveler, to the realm of
      Psycho Chess. Thy privacy is of great import to us. This Privacy Policy
      doth expound upon how we gather, employ, and shield thy most valued
      information whilst thou dost partake in our online multiplayer team
      deathmatch game.
      <br />
      <h1><br />1. That Which We Doth Collect</h1>
      When thou dost engage in the Game, we mayst gather the following:
      <br />
      - Thy chosen name (with cunning enchantments to banish words most foul)
      <br />
      - Missives exchanged in the heat of battle (held but briefly for watchful
      moderation, with spells cast to cleanse unseemly utterances) <br />
      - Records of thy noble feats and interactions upon the battlefield
      <br />
      <h1>Know ye this:</h1>
      We gather not such details as would betray thy mortal self, such as thy
      true name, parchment of contact, or dwelling of abode. <br />
      <h1><br />2. Of The Use of That Which We Collect</h1>
      That which we gather serveth thus: <br />
      - To enrich and refine thy sojourn in the Game <br />
      - To preserve an arena of honor and respect <br />
      - To thwart knavish deeds and uphold the sacred tenets of our fellowship
      <br />
      <h1><br />3. Of The Safekeeping of Thy Data</h1>
      We employ valiant measures to guard thy data 'gainst the grasp of rogues
      and tricksters. Missives, once read, are cast into the void anon, shared
      not with outsiders nor vile meddlers. <br />
      <h1><br />4. Of The Services of Third Parties</h1>
      The Game doth not render thy data unto merchants or peddlers for their
      gain. Yet, we may employ trusted allies to host and sustain our noble
      endeavor, and they, too, abide by covenants of privacy most sacred.
      <br />
      <h1><br />5. Of The Young Squires Who Partake</h1>
      The Game is forged in a manner fit for gentle folk of all ages, that none
      be turned away nor led astray. <br />
      <h1><br />6. If Thou Dost Seek Counsel</h1>
      Should queries or concerns stir within thee, seek us at
      <a href ="https://github.com/LeechLab">github.com/LeechLab</href> </a> where
      thou mayst pen thine inquiries beneath the Psycho Chess repository.
      <br />By stepping upon the battlefield of Psycho Chess, thou dost swear
      fealty to the decrees set forth in this sacred Privacy Policy. <br />
      <h1><br />Go forth, and may thy wits be ever keen!</h1>
